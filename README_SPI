Description of SPI Communication

SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface. 
It is frequently used when few I/O lines are available, but communication between two or more devices must be fast and easy to implement. SPI is a synchronous protocol that allows a master device to initiate communication with a slave device. 

The Maple microcontroller has 3 SPI hardware modules
The Maple Mini has ??
The Maple Native has ??

The great advantage of using this protocol is it simplifies the communication with the sensor module. In fact, there is no need to generate the serial clock, as it is generated by the microcontroller. You only have to place data and commands in a buffer and the microcontroller send it. (Same utilization than an USART). 

This protocol needs a minimum of three lines between the master and a slave. An additional line must be added for each slave in multi-slave operations in order to select it.

The communication between a master and a slave is always a data transfer. 
When the master sends something, it will receive a data at the same time. If the data received is not read, it will be lost at next data transfer. 
When the master wants to receive something, it has to send a dummy data to shift the answer placed in the slave's shift register.
