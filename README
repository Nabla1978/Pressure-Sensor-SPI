Purpose of this library is to let communicate:
- Maple micro-controller (http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/) 
- IntersemaÂ’'s (http://www.intersema.ch/) pressure sensor modules (MS55XX series) via SPI protocol. 

Models that can be used are:
- MS5535-C / MS5535-CM / MS5535-30C
- MS5541-C / MS5541-CM / MS5541-30C
Differences are in pressure rating, pin dimensions and gel insulation, but SPI communication is exactly the same.
At the moment Intersema had introduced a new model 5803-xxBA, that should be not compatible with the following library.

Most of the library is based on application note AN501.pdf downloadable via Intersema website.

Note:
Two parameters need to be checked or adjusted in the configuration of Maple SPI module:
- Clock Idle state must be low.
- Transmission must occur on rising edge of the serial clock when the microcontroller wants to send data received by the sensor. 
- On the other side, when the microcontroller wants to receive data sent by the sensor transmission must occur on the falling edge of the clock.

Since this is my first library, i'm copying almost everything from other repos :-)

I don't understand if i'll use an hard and software SPI for communication because i don't know the difference :)

????????????????
If hardware SPI is used the pins SCLK and DN(MOSI) must be on pin 13 and 11 and pin 10 must (and is) set to output on Arduino. Same pins
for SPI1 on Maple and pins 34 and 32 for SPI2 (untested). ???

Serial clock is ???? 4.5 for Maple (2.25 for SPI2? Fix?)

?????????????????????????????????????????????????
If software SPI is used you can chose any pins for the display.
The sluggish shiftOut is used for soft SPI, serial clock is about 66kHz on Arduino and 534 kHz on Maple.

In the examples the lcd is connected as:

LCD        Arduino/Maple
8-LED      220ohm resistor to 5V or 22ohm to 3V3
7-SCLK     13 (sclk_pin)
6-DN(MOSI) 11 (sdin_pin)
5-D/C      5  (dc_pin)
4-RST      6  (reset_pin)
3-SCE      7  (cs_pin)
2-GND      GND
1-VCC      3V3 (NOT 5V!)
