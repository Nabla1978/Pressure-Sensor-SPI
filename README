This is a library for a Pressure Sensor SPI-based for the Maple (http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/).
The Pressure Sensor that will be used for development is from Intersema (http://www.intersema.ch/) 
More in detail, the models that should be used are:

MS5535-C / MS5535-CM / MS5535-30C
MS5541-C / MS5541-CM / MS5541-30C
Differences are in pressure rating, pin dimensions and gel insulation, but SPI communication is exactly the same.
At the moment Intersema had introduced a new model 5803-xxBA, that should be not compatible with the following library.


Since this is my first library, i'm copying almost everything from other repos :-)

I don't understand if i'll use an hard and software SPI for communication because i don't know the difference :)

????????????????
If hardware SPI is used the pins SCLK and DN(MOSI) must be on pin
13 and 11 and pin 10 must (and is) set to output on Arduino. Same pins
for SPI1 on Maple and pins 34 and 32 for SPI2 (untested). ???

Serial clock is ???? 4.5 for Maple (2.25 for SPI2? Fix?)

?????????????????????????????????????????????????
If software SPI is used you can chose any pins for the display.
The sluggish shiftOut is used for soft SPI, serial clock
is about 66kHz on Arduino and 534 kHz on Maple.

In the examples the lcd is connected as:

LCD        Arduino/Maple
8-LED      220ohm resistor to 5V or 22ohm to 3V3
7-SCLK     13 (sclk_pin)
6-DN(MOSI) 11 (sdin_pin)
5-D/C      5  (dc_pin)
4-RST      6  (reset_pin)
3-SCE      7  (cs_pin)
2-GND      GND
1-VCC      3V3 (NOT 5V!)
